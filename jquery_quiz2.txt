1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if
   they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
   //code fragment 1
   $("li").each(function(idx, e) {
    $(e).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
   //code fragment 2
   $("li").each(function() {
    $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
   //code fragment 3
   $("li").each(function(idx) {
    $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
A:
All three code fragments are effectively the same since all of them select all li elements and set their color to yellow.
The first code fragment the anonymous function used in the '.each()' method takes two argument 'idx' and 'e', where 'idx'
is the index of the current element and 'e' is the element itself from the matched set.
In fragment 2, the anonymous function takes no argument and the element in each iteration is referred to by using 'this'.
In fragment 3, the anonymous function takes a single argument 'idx' which represents the index of the current element from
the set and the element here is also referenced to by using 'this'.
All of these code fragment ultimately refer to the same element in each iteration of the loop.

2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include an unordered list in them, and make
their text color be blue.
 <div>no ul here </div>
 <div>
 This does contain a ul.
 <ul>
 <li>the first item</li>
 <li>the second item</li>
 </ul>
 </div>
 <script>
A:    $("div:has(ul)").css("color", "blue");
 </script>
 </body>


3. Write jQuery code to append the following div element (and all of its contents) dynamically to the body
element.
<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>
HTML:
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head>
 <meta charset="utf-8">
 <title>JS Bin</title>
 </head>
 <body>

 </body>
 </html>
A:
  $('body').append($("<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>"));
