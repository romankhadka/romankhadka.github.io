1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?
A:
The $() or jQuery() function, which is used to generate a jQuery object, is referred to as the "jQuery function".
jQuery(selector) or $(selector), where the selector is a CSS-style selector that matches one or more DOM elements, are essentially shorthand ways of writing those expressions.
The object that the jQuery function returns when it is called with a selector is referred to as the "jQuery object".
A group of DOM elements that match the selection are contained in this object, which is an instance of the jQuery class.
So, a jQuery object, which is a collection of DOM components that can be modified using jQuery methods, is created by the jQuery function.
A jquery function is used to create a jquery object.


2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background
   color red.
   Sample HTML:
   <body>
   <h1>abc</h1><br><div>
    <h1>div-1</h1>
    <h1>div-2</h1>
    </div>
    <h1>xyz</h1>
   </body>
A:
$("div h1").css("background-color", "red");

3. 3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
   <script>
   <!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
   </script>
   </head>
   <body>
   <p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
   </body>
   </html>
A:
$("p").append("YES!");
